**CyberDeck** is a portable device, usually a personnel computer that has a form of an all-in-one box with screen and input controls or a "box+keyboard". Also, it is a subculture of cyberpunk lovers who also like a post-apocalypse theme. These people usually build their boxes and share its photos on the [r/CyberDeck](https://old.reddit.com/r/cyberDeck/).

I ([/who/astynax]()) want do build one for myself :) Here I plan to do my research, keep links and thoughts about.

# A core of Deck

[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) looks as "the right solution" but there are not many variants of boards with RISC-V CPUs.

A way more popular an accessible alternative is [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) family and [RPi-400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400) and [CM4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4) in particular.

I also have a [GameShell](https://www.clockworkpi.com/gameshell) and potentially can to use it as a core of CyberDeck.

I ([/who/astynax]()) don't like all the modern CSS stuff and I'm trying to avoid it when I can. That's why most of my projects have a small bits of CSS, usually, made by me.

But there are good projects that are trying to be as simple as possible but still have a good look. Here I plan to keep a small list of those projects.

# Good ones

- [blocks.css](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/) "adds a layer of dimension to your web elements. It's light enough that it takes no time to set up or load, but interesting enough that it can serve as the only major CSS on the page". Looks pretty suitable for simple Web [/GUI]()s.
- [paper.css](https://thesephist.github.io/paper.css/), "a spiritual successor to blocks.css", it "carries the same simplicity, focus on a single visual motif, and customizability thorugh CSS variables.". Also looks very nice but more "site-like".

# Notable ones

- ["bettermotherf**kingwebsite"](https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/) (the successor of ["motherf**kingwebsite"](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/)), minimal-to-nothing set of styles that make "plain HTML" look quite readable!

    The whole style tag from the mentioned site:

    ```html
    <style type="text/css">
      body{
        margin: 40p auto;
        max-width: 650px;
        line-height: 1.6;
        font-size: 18px;
        color: #444;
        padding: 0 10px
      }
      h1, h2, h3{
        line-height: 1.2
      }
    </style>
    ```

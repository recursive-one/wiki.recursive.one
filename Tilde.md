# Tildes

Each **Tilde** is a small community built around a single multi-user machine, usually running a Unix-like OS.

Any member of the community has SSH access to its `/home/~username` and can build there a site, personal page, such stuff. For you server has a bunch of compilers and interpreters installed aside with popular editors ([/Emacs](), [/Vim]()) and [version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) ([/Git](), [/Mercurial]()). You may think about it as a shared sandbox. 

The server itself usually provides

- intranet email (sort of)
- local-only IRC chat
- local bulletin board (BBS)
- multi-user games (MUD)
- PasteBin-like service

[Tildeverse](https://tildeverse.org/) tries to be a hub for all the tildes around the World. It will be your starting point to choose a server and request the invitation. Yep, almost any Tilde register newcomers through the good-old emails :)

# Why

Just for fun! If you as me myself ([/who/astynax]()) was not involved in the world of shared machines you can fill such a gap in the experience and try to "live" inside a small machine with very limited resources!

I ([/who/astynax]()) really like to solder something from time to time.

Especially, I like to play with programmable devices: [/Micro:bit](), [/Arduino](), you name it. And [/Raspberry Pi]() of course, how can I forget? Many of such devices can be programmed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

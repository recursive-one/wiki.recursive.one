# Exocortex, exobrain?... Knowledge base!

> An [exocortex](https://transhumanism.fandom.com/wiki/Exocortex) is an external information processing system that augments the brain's biological high-level cognitive processes.

You may think what exocortex is just a new/fancy name for the good old [/Knowledge base](). This Wiki for example I ([/who/astynax]()) was planned to use as my exobrain (yep, another fancy word).

## Zettelkasten

A way to link small notes and can use such links to get some insights about the big areas of information.

## Outliners

## Wikis

Usually, Wiki is a Web-app but it can be also in a form of a desktop app.

- [Gitit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit) (powers this wiki, written in [/Haskell])
- [IkiWiki](https://ikiwiki.info) an old one, simplistic, lightweight, Perl-driven
- [Mycorrhiza](https://github.com/bouncepaw/mycorrhiza), "Filesystem and git-based wiki engine". Lightweight and capable to run on systems like Raspberry Pi ([here is](https://mycorrhiza.lesarbr.es/page/home) a wiki about it)

## "Files & folders"

A way to keep all the info in the file system and have some sort of indexing over it.

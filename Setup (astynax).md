title: Astynax's setup (OS, apps, etc)
...

# OS

For many years the [/Linux]() is my main OS. On physical machines, I prefer the [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com/) because "it just works". And I'm pretty happy with it. Yes, sometimes I am adding some PPA's or Snap packages, but I'm ready to pay this price.

# Desktop Environment

Just the [XFCE](https://xfce.org/) with the [/i3]() as a Window Manager. Most of the interactions with the OS I am doing with on-screen menus those I made myself with [/rofi](). This setup is pretty good as for small laptop screen as for multi-display configurations.

# The one editor

I love the GNU [/Emacs](). I'm not using it as OS (yet?), but Emacs is my IDE, note taking app, GTD app (I'm not so into GTD, actually). An entire editor's ecosystem I did configure myself without [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org/), [DooM Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs), or any other "builds".

Actually I am using the [/Vim]() for quick and casual editing when I am working in terminal. But I'm trying to switch to Emacs for such activities too...

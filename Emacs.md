title: GNU Emacs
toc: no
...

I ([/who/astynax]()) use Emacs for anything, it is "the true one editor" for me: programming, note-taking, GTD, Web-bookmarks - Emacs helps me doing it. The main reason to use Emacs is its extensibility and the ability to bend an editor to the shape I like and find comfortable. Someone tweaks her bike or a car buys and replaces some old parts with new ones. I am doing the same with my editor and I like this process! :)

## My configuration

You can find it [here](https://github.com/astynax/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs) with other [/dotfiles]().

### use-package

The capstone of my config is the [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package): this package configures all other packages and even downloads them if some of it isn't present in the system.

## Org mode

The [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) - the main (and even *the only* for someone) reason to use Emacs. It is an IDE for notes, TODOs, agendas, contacts, writing, research. If I need to produce a good portion of text I am writing it in Org and then export it into the target format (Markdown, HTML, etc).

## Magit

[Magit](https://magit.vc/) - the one thing to doing Git. Just it.

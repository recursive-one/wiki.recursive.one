I ([/who/astynax]()) use [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for anything, it is "the true one editor" for me: programming, note-taking, GTD, Web-bookmarks - Emacs helps me doing it. The main reason to use Emacs is its extensibility and the ability to bend an editor to the shape I like and find comfortable. Someone tweaks her bike or a car buys and replaces some old parts with new ones. I am doing the same with my editor and I like this process! :)

# My configuration

You can find it [here](https://github.com/astynax/dotfiles/blob/master/.emacs) with other [/dotfiles]().

# use-package

The capstone of my config is the [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package): this package configures all other packages and even downloads them if some of them aren't present in the system yet.

Alternatively, one can use [straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el) to install packages from their sources. This is even more "declarative and predictable" way to manage packages but I did'n  try it yet.

# Shell scripting

One can use Emacs as a general purpose scripting language.

For example, one can integrate [emacs-server](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Emacs-Server.html), [/Rofi]() & [/mpv]() to listen Internet-radio and be able to choose a station using GUI â€” [cool stuff](https://isamert.net/2022/03/16/global-interactive-emacs-functions.html)!

# Org mode

The [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/) - the main (and even *the only* for someone) reason to use Emacs. It is an IDE for notes, TODOs, agendas, contacts, writing, research. If I need to produce a good portion of text I am writing it in Org and then export it into the target format (Markdown, HTML, etc).

[Org babel](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html) I use to do some [/Literate programming]() or just to play with some HTTP APIs. For the later task I use [restlient.el](https://github.com/pashky/restclient.el)+[ob-restclient.el](https://github.com/alf/ob-restclient.el).

# Magit

[Magit](https://magit.vc/) is the ultimate way to do [/Git]() and to learn it in the process. Just a must-have.

Some great resources about Magit:

# Debugging

Yep, sometimes you need to debug your config. There are two ways:

1. `(setq debug-on-error t)` at the beginning of your `.emacs`
2. `-debug-init` in command line

Also, you can edit the config using "quick mode": `emacs -q .emacs` or `emacs -Q .emacs`. Or you can just use [/Vim](): `vim .emacs` ;)

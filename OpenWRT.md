[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) is a [/Linux]() distribution originally targeting <strong>W</strong>ireless <strong>R</strong>ou<strong>T</strong>ers but for now any suitable embedded devices ([/DIY/electronics]()!).

Often OpenWRT helps to build the "own clouds" (see [/self-hosting]()).

# Derivatives

  > an open source, portable digital file distribution tool based on inexpensive hardware that enables delivery of educational, healthcare, and other vital information to individuals off the grid.

  > LibraryBox is a combination of a router (a variety of hardware will work), USB drive, and software that, when combined, give you a small, low powered webserver. The webserver acts like a captive portal, and delivers files that are stored on the USB drive.

  - [BiblioBox](https://bibliobox.net/), the "Nomadic device allowing access to digital resources" (G-translated from "Dispositif nomade permettant d’accéder à des ressources numériques"), a fork of LibraryBox. The site is made using [/TiddlyWiki]().

- [PirateBox](https://piratebox.cc) (+ the ["/r/PirateBox"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piratebox/) subreddit)

# Gardening

Digital Garden is kind of a personal website that grows like a real garden - if the author isn't forgetting to moisture the silt and rid of dead plants. There is no such thing as "static content": every plant either grows or dies. Also, there is no explicit timeline as it is in blogs because every live piece lives continuously :)

Usually, DG consists of the Garden itself and the Stream. The Stream *has* a timeline but contains only the sketches and random thoughts some of that may become the new plants. Storing of thoughts within the stream is a part of using your DG as the [/Exocortex](). Most of the "gardeners" are using streams as diaries or personal microblogs and the whole idea looks pretty appealing to me ([/who/astynax]()).

- [Blue Dot's Digital Garden](https://bluedot.neocities.org/garden/), a nice example of a "handmade" garden. The content itself isn't that interesting but the "Garden Script" ([/Python]()) looks fun!

[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) is a dialect of [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), which is a member of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) family. The language is dynamically typed, multiparadigm, [/FP]() capable. Racket has an interactive REPL, a cross-platform compiler, even the dedicated IDE (Dr.Racket).

The core idea behind the language is "Language-Oriented Programming": you are designing and implementing the domain-specific languages just for every domain you work with! Here is a great talk about LOP: ["Lambda World 2019 - Language-Oriented Programming with Racket"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8Pz4bJV3Tk)".

The Racket as a platform has a nice set of "batteries". For example, a really great set of libraries to work with graphics/animations/games. Here is a talk about this aspect: ["big-bang: the world, universe, and network in the programming language"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayoofXuKqMY). I have played with this stuff myself: made some pieces of *generative art*. You can take a look at them [here](https://astynax.neocities.org/daily-art/).

Another thing in Racket world I played with is [/Pollen](): my [recursive.one](https://recursive.one) site was made using it.

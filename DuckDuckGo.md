[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) is a search engine I ([/who/astynax]()) use daily on all my devices. Even if I need to ["google"](https://google.com) something I prefer to use the `!g` *bang* (see below) than Google itself.

# Bangs

The DDG's [bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang) is just a "killer feature" for me. I feel more comfortable to remember some bangs (a dozen at least) than to set up many custom "searches" in all browsers I have. Here are some examples I found useful:

- `!gi` - Google Image search
- `!wen` - search over English Wikipedia
- `!gh` - search over GitHub
- `!hackage` - search over [/Haskell]() packages
- `!python` - search over [/Python]() docs
- `!pypi` - search over Python packages
- `!define` - search for word's definitions

# Why

Just because it faster (the search page is pretty lightweight) and more [private](https://duckduckgo.com/app).

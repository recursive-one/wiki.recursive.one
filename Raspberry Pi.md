# Boards

["Raspberry Pi"](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a name of a family of small computer boards for the hobbyists.

In the family are the pure [computation modules](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4) and the whole computers like [Pi 400](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-400/).

The whole RPi idea is quite popular. So, there are many "clones" like [Orange Pi](http://www.orangepi.org/) and [Banana Pi](http://www.banana-pi.org/) and also pretty distinct boards like [Clockwork Pi](https://www.clockworkpi.com/).

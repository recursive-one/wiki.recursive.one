[GNU Bash](https://github.com/secretGeek/ok-bash/) is a command shell for the [/Linux]() (and other OSes).

I ([/who/astynax]()) am still using Bash as my main (and only?) shell even after I tried [/Zsh](), [fish](https://fishshell.com/) and some the others. Bash looks like a "boring" choice but I just know well how to cook it. Though, I prefer do not write bash-scripts: I just use [/Python]() or [/Haskell]()/[/Turtle (library)]() instead.

There are many [ways](https://ohmybash.nntoan.com/) to make bash fancier and add mode modern features. But I prefer to add only things I will use daily. Here I listed a couple of such things.

# sharship

[/Starship]() it is a way to get a powerful and informative prompt (PS1) and don't write a pile of bash-scripts.

# ok-bash

This [ok-bash](https://github.com/secretGeek/ok-bash/) somehow looks just like a replacement for the [/GNU Make]() that I'm using already. But actually, I use `ok` "just for me" and Make "for the people": the former one helps me to remember long commands and the latter one does the heavy-lifting (project building mostly).

# fzf

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) just makes an auto-completion work quick, fast, and file-system-wide.

# BBC Micro:bit

[BBC Micro:bit](https://microbit.org) is a [development board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor_development_board) for the hobbyists who are just starting to dig into electronics. The board is pretty capable itself but also one has access to the vast ecosystem of extensions. Or one can just connect its micro:bit somewhere with a couple of [crocodile clips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_clip).

# Programming

Micro:bit can be programmed using [MicroPython](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io) a lightweight subset of [/Python]() language. Also, one can use the [MakeCode Editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/) and program the device visually.

# Resources

- [microfs](https://github.com/ntoll/microfs), a CLI-tool that helps to manage files on the micro:bit's "file system". That files can be Python modules or just assets for your program (you can just `open()` it!).

I love computers, SciFi ([/Science Fiction]()), other geek stuff.

Usually I do [/FP]() in [/Emacs]() using my [/ThinkPad]() with Ubuntu [/Linux]() (see [/Setup (astynax)]()).

Like to make [/GUI]() and [/CLI]() apps, do some [/gamedev]() and digital art, that stuff.

Also, I love to solder things from time to time, to do some microcontroller programming, to light some LEDs. Want to make my own [/CyberDeck]() someday.

In this wiki I am usually writing about programming languages, OSes, coding [puzzles](/_category/puzzle "wiki category"). This is a *"Garden"* part of my [/Digital Garden](). Someday I put here the *"Stream"* part too :)

# Rinat "histrio" Sabitov

Just a python developer and most of my public work you can find [here](https://github.com/histrio/). Most of my public contacts listed [here](https://keybase.io/histrio/).

If you, for some reason, want to grant me access to your server run that:

```bash
$ curl https://github.com/histrio.keys >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

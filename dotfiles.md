## Yadm

For now I am organizing it with [Yadm](https://yadm.io/) and this way works perfectly fine for me. It is as simple as plain [/Git]() (Yadm stays on its shoulders). So I won't need to learn anything new just to do this important but a little tedious work. The one thing I need to worry about it is suitable `.gitignore`.

# SmallTalk

[Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) is a pretty distinct OOP language that is really good to demonstrate the power of the object orientation itself. Also, this language can be used as an example of the truly integrated desktop environments: Smalltalk IDE is embedded into the language's VM and written in Smalltalk - and pretty hackable too! One can just open the REPL-like dialog window and send messages to the "Close" button of some randomly selected window and see instant feedback!

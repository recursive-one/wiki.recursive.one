[Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) is a sub-family on programming languages in the large Lisp family.

# Implementations

- [/Racket](), a modern language that extends the good old Scheme in various ways
- [Chicken Scheme](https://call-cc.org/), a portable and effective compiler for the Scheme language
- [Guile](https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/), "an extension language platform" and "and the official extension language of the [GNU project](https://gnu.org)". Was used to make the [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) [/Linux]() distribution
- [Kawa](https://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/index.html), an extension of the R7RS standard of the Scheme language. Runs on JVM and has nice interoperability with the Java itself
- [Biwa](https://www.biwascheme.org), a small implementation written in JavaScript. Runs inside the web browser, i.e. there is no transpilation!
